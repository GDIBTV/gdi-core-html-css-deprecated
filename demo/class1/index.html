	<h1>My First Web Page</h1>

	<p>In Girl Develop It's Beginning HTML and CSS class, we'll learn a lot of basic <strong>HTML</strong> elements and <strong>CSS</strong> to style them.</p>

	<p>It'll be fun!</p>

	<h2>The Basics</h2>

	<p>A simple website may not be flashy, but we're learning the building blocks of web development. Every website out there is built using what we're learning.</p>

	<h3>Images Are Always Interesting</h3>

	<p>Many people think the internet is built only for sharing photos of cats (<em>and sometimes dogs</em>). There's no denying that images make any website more interesting.</p>

	<a href="http://girldevelopit.com" title="Images can be linked, too!" target="_blank">

	<h3>It's All Connected</h3>

	<!-- Remember, white space doesn't matter. None of the line breaks below will show in the text. -->
	<p>The World Wide Web is called a web for a 
		reason. That reason is the hyperlink. You'll 
		make many link elements in the future. If you 
		ever forget how, 
		<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=how%20to%20make%20a%20link%20in%20html" title="The most popular search engine">Google</a> can help.

	<h4>A list of helpful links</h4>

	<ul>
		<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML" title="MDN HTML Resources">HTML Info from Mozilla Developer Network</a></li>

		<li><a href="https://developer.chrome.com/devtools" title="This tool is a lifesaver">Developer Tools Overview</a></li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Fun With CSS</h3>

	<p>In class 2, we'll finally be able to add colors, change fonts, and do so much more.</p>

	<h4>My Favorite Colors</h4>

	<p>My favorite colors also happen to have names in HTML.</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Fuchia</li>
		<li>Orange</li>
		<li>Silver</li>
	</ol>

	<h5>HTML/CSS Color List</h5>

	<p>In addition to the 17 original colors, modern CSS has <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value">a ton more</a>. I really like <strong>darkturquoise</strong>.</p>
